Long’s shirt has soaked through with sweat after standing outside for a just a few minutes waiting for his motorcycle taxi driver in Bangkok.
Long said it had been a very long time since he’d experienced that kind of heat.
The sun is already high in the sky when the 27-year-old account specialist at a Bangkok media agency leaves for work at around 7:30a.m. every morning.
Walking from his house to the SkyTrain station about 300 meters away feels like torture. There’s no shade from trees, only the concrete jungle of downtown Bangkok making things worse by absorbing the heat and blasting it back at pedestrians.
To minimize his exposure to the heat and the sunlight, Long goes to work early in the morning and only leaves his office after the sun sets.
But it’s impossible to completely avoid the heat that’s swept over Thailand and neighboring countries.
"Every time the SkyTrain stops at platforms and opens its doors for people to get on and off, I feel like I’m standing between the worlds of the hot and the cold weather," Long said.
He’s been spending a lot more money on sunscreen in Thailand than he used to in Vietnam, and he said dust levels in Bangkok have worsened since the heatwave began attacking the city.
"My coworkers and acquaintances say they’ve encountered breathing problems caused by the dust [since the start of the heatwave]," he said.
