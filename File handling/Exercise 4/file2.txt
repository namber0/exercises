Long is one of many Vietnamese abroad facing the severe Southeast Asian heatwave in the countries.
According to CNN, temperatures in Thailand reached over 45 degrees Celsius for the first time in history around 10 days ago. The northwest Thai city of Tak recorded a temperature of 45.4 degrees Celsius, while other regions in the country have been in the upper 30s to low 40s since last month.
These days when Tien, 29, who works for a media company in Bangkok, goes to work early in the morning, he already feels tired due to the sweltering heat in the Thai capital city.
Tien said the hot weather begin in late March and there have been several days in which the temperature reached 40 degrees Celsius. The scorching weather usually lasts from early morning until 4-5 p.m.
"During lunch break, me and my colleagues often order food to the office instead of going out for lunch because it’s too hot outside," Tien said. "I’m hesitant to be on the street in this sizzling weather."
Other countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, have been hit by unusually high temperatures as well.
Mai, 27, an office worker in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, came across a news report warning about an upcoming heatwave while watching local TV earlier this month.
Since then, the weather has become hotter. The whole of Malaysia is now experiencing hotter weather, with certain regions reaching between 35 and 37 degrees Celsius for at least three days in a row.
"I saw people coming to the local clinic due to heat exhaustion," Mai said. "A couple of days ago, I almost had a similar experience. After spending two hours outside my house, of which one was even shopping indoors, I felt dehydrated and experienced symptoms of heat exhaustion."
